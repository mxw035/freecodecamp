            <h1>Welcome to Monica's Portfolio</h1>
                <p>In this portfolio you will see projects from the free code camp responsive web design certification.</p>
            
            <h1 id="project-title">Projects</h1>
            <h2 id="tribute">Tribute.html</h2>
                <p>The tribute page had a goal of describing a person and their life achievements.</p>
                <p>I am a huge Harry Potter fan and Luna Lovegood is one of my faviorte charecters in the book.</p>
                <p>I have even written my own fanfiction story about her early childhood experience.</p>
                <p>This page contains a main section, title, div with img and img caption with in it. A list of facts about the
                charecter throught out thier life. A link to where you can find more information. I have also added my own touch as
                a link to my fanfiction story or at least what I have written thus far.</p>

            <h2 id="survey">Survey.html</h2>
                <p>The Survey page goal was to create a form and accept input from users.</p>
                <p>This page contained a title, descrition, survey-form, input for name, email, age, as well as a dropdown menu,
                radio button selection, check box selection and submit button.</p>
                <p>I chose to make my survey page ask the user for their information as well as get their response to two triva questions
                about Luna. I also had a textbox section that allowed the user to share their favorite information about Luna.</p>

            <h2 id="landing">Landing.html</h2>
                <p>This page served as a basic landing page providing information on products for sale as well as taking user
                input regarding purchase.</p>
                <p>This consisted of header, img, navbar, video, form, input for email, as well as radio buttons to select project
                and submit button. The subsricption options are also contained within a flex box.</p>
                <p>I chose to make this page for selling subscriptions to the quibbler. The Quibbler is a magazine that is put out
                by Luna's father. The Quibbler is known for its exclussive interview with Harry Potter in year 5 as well as
                keeping it readers up to date on the real news during the wizarding war. That is until Luna is held hostage by the
                deatheaters.</p>

            <h2 id="doc">Documentation.html</h2>
                <p>Doumentation shows information regaurding basic html and css code.</p>
                <p>It consists of the following elements main, section, header, p, code, ul, li, navbar, and anchors.</p>
                <p>For this project I went over the specific elements used on my Luna Lovegood pages. That way users could potentially
                build their own site.</p>
