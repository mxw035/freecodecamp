                        <p>The video element defines the height and width of the viewer to see the video, controls shows the
                        controls for the video and then source of course provides the file path or length as well as the type of
                        video file.</p>

                        <p>I frame is very similar to the video element but is used specifically for youtube videos. As seen here you still
                        define the hieight and width as well as the link so that useres can view the video while still on your page. </p>

                            <p>As you can see above and after my own testing the default settings for elements div, header, nav, and p
                            are all the same size.</p>
                            <p>Headers are slightly different and decrease in size form h1- h6. The elements listed about are
                            all about the same dementions as h4 by default however h4 does not server as a container. The difference
                            in elements names instead of using div for everthing is to provided oragnization to your html page.</p>

                        <p>Above is a basic skeleton code for a html webpage. As you can see using the code element on your html page
                        changes the text size and shape to differentiate code from other text. By adding .code { } to the style element
                        you can also change the back ground to better help distinguish code. I have made mine aqua color with black text. </p>

                This is completed by:</p>
                <code>
                    .h1 {
                        broder-radius:12px;
                        }
                </code>
                <p>You can also make your background an image instead of a color by doing this:</p>
                <code>
                    body {
                        background-img: url('link goes here');
                </code>
                <p>Also helpful tip that will make your html look less cluttered. You do not need to put all your style code in the head
                section. You can instead create a stylesheet.css and keep all you style code in that file. This will allow you to
                decrease clutter on you html page and also to use the css code on multiple pages. All you need to do is reference the
                link in the head element as follows</p>
                <code>
                    link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"
                </code>
